# rmp-specs

This repository contains the design specifications for Remapped Protocol (RMP).

It is intentionally implementation-agnostic:
- Describes expected behavior and interfaces
- Documents constraints and non-goals
- Enables review without increasing operational attack surface

Canonical project links:
- Website: https://remappedprotocol.org
- Docs: https://remappedprotocol.org/docs
- Whitepaper (PDF): https://remappedprotocol.org/Remapped_Protocol_Whitepaper_v1.1.pdf
- Security contact: security@remappedprotocol.org

## Scope
- Architecture overviews (message verification + identity)
- Runtime interfaces (extrinsics, events, storage keys)
- Threat model and security posture

## Non-goals
This repository does not contain:
- Executable runtime code
- Deployment scripts or infrastructure topology
- Production parameters, keys, or genesis configuration
