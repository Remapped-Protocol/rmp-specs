# Threat model (draft)

## Assumptions
- Network conditions may be adversarial or intermittent
- Nodes and operators may fail or churn
- Message transport may be delayed, replayed, or partially observed
- No single trusted operator is assumed

## Goals
- Maintain verifiability of attestations
- Constrain administrative authority
- Ensure actions are auditable and predictable

## Out of scope (for now)
- Full anonymity guarantees
- Complex incentive mechanisms
- Token-based governance security considerations
