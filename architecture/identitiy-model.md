# Identity model

## Design objective
Provide deterministic, auditable identity attestation without granting authority based on token ownership.

## Principles
- Identity controls are explicit and constrained
- Authority boundaries are auditable
- Token ownership does not grant identity privileges

## Model overview
RMP maintains identity-related records sufficient to:
- establish stable identifiers
- support verification workflows
- enable constrained governance actions (where applicable)

## Non-goals
- Creating a universal identity system
- Selling identity access
- Token-weighted identity authority
