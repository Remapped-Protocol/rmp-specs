# Specification Policy

This repository contains design specifications for Remapped Protocol (RMP).

## Canonical sources
- The website documentation is the public canonical source:
  https://remappedprotocol.org/docs
- This repository mirrors and extends those docs with implementation-agnostic specifications.

If there is a conflict, the website is authoritative until resolved.

## Change philosophy
- Specs are updated when decisions are locked.
- Drafts should be marked clearly as draft.
- Breaking changes must be recorded in CHANGELOG.md with a rationale.

## Security
Do not include:
- keys or secrets
- infrastructure topology
- deployment scripts
- production parameters
